## What's the Tentacle Shield?
An Arduino shield to host and individually isolate up to 4 EZO Circuits from Atlas Scientific to measure PH, Dissolved Oxygen, Electric Conductivity (E.C.), Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) and RTD (Temperature).

* 4 channels
* 5V only

Individually isolated measurement circuits and communication lines prevent noise and ground loops for precise measurements even in closed-loop systems.
